# diskCr10v3Marlin
Disk1of5 CR10 V3 Marlin Firmware
based off of the great work of https://git.pickysysadmin.ca/FiZi/cr-10-v3-marlin-config

## Changes
1) reduced Z height for cable chain and Zsync Kit
2) auto build docker automation.
3) I wanted to put a custom disk logo in.


## Disclamer
Offered "as-is", without warranty, and disclaiming liability for damages resulting from using the firmware
